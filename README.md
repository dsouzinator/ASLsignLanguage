# ASLsignLanguage
A deep learning network trained to identify ASL alphabets from a live video stream. The letters X, Z, 'nothing' and 'cancel' were excluded from this dataset.

A future goal is to add these letters into a word along with an autocorrect feature.
The dataset can be obtained from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet).
